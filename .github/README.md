# ðŸš€ My ever-changing dotfiles configuration

## Setup

### If `yadm` is installed

```bash
yadm clone https://github.com/JoaquinTrinanes/dotfiles
```

### If `yadm` isn't installed

```bash
curl -L bootstrap.yadm.io | bash -s -- https://github.com/JoaquinTrinanes/dotfiles
```

## Bootstrap

After cloning the repo, `yadm` should offer to run the bootstrap script. It can be manually executed with `yadm bootstrap`.
